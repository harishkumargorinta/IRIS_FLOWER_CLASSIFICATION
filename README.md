# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

This Python project aims to classify iris flowers into different species based on their features. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to train a model on the Iris dataset and then predicts the species of iris flowers based on their characteristics.

## Overview

The Iris Flower Classification project serves as a classic example in the field of machine learning. It addresses the problem of classifying iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The classification is based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - The Iris dataset is included in the project directory as `iris.csv`. However, you can also use your own dataset following the same structure.

2. Train the model:
   - Run the training script to train the machine learning model using the Iris dataset.
   ```
   python train.py
   ```

3. Predict iris species:
   - Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the species of iris flowers based on their characteristics.
   ```
   python predict.py
   ```

## File Descriptions

- `train.py`: Script for training the machine learning model using the Iris dataset.
- `predict.py`: Script for making predictions using the trained model.
- `iris.csv`: Dataset containing iris flower features and species labels.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the project.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
